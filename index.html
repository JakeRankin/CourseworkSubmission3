                In March I competed in the north of Scotland bagpipe quartets competition with Buchan pipeband. The competition took place at
                Gordon Schools in Huntly, where there were over sixty entries in the competition.

                This was my first competition with the Buchan pipeband and even though it was a small competition I was still nervous.
                Despite my nerves the band played well, taking first place over the four bands that competed in our grade.
                <br> <br>
                Here is a map of Gordon Schools in Huntly, where the competition took place.
