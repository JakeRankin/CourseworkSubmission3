                On Sunday the fifteenth of May the Banchory pipeband competition will be taking place. I will be there competing with Buchan
                pipeband in grade 2, were we hope to do well and hope for good weather.
                <br> <br>
                I am due to finish year three of a four year BSc in computer network management and design at Rober Gordon University.

                In March I competed in the north of Scotland bagpipe quartets competition with Buchan pipeband. The competition took place at
                Gordon Schools in Huntly, where there were over sixty entries in the competition.

                This was my first competition with the Buchan pipeband and even though it was a small competition I was still nervous.
                Despite my nerves the band played well, taking first place over the four bands that competed in our grade.
